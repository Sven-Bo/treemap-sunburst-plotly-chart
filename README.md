# Create A Treemap & Sunburst Chart In Python Using Plotly & Excel

In this tutorial, I will show you, how to create a Treemap & Sunburst Chart in Python by using the library called Plotly.

The data is coming directly from an excel file.
You can do all the changes in the excel file and after running the code again you will have your updated Treemap/Sunburst.
The Treemap/Sunburst Chart is interactive and will be saved as an HTML file.
